# @nocturne/screenshots

Captures the screenshots the documentation embeds, so they are regenerated from a running app
rather than pasted in by hand and left to rot.

`src/manifest.ts` declares what to shoot. A run seeds a throwaway dev tenant per scenario, signs a
browser in, and writes `images/{id}.{theme}.webp` plus `manifest.json` — alt text, image dimensions
and anchor boxes, keyed by id. `src/types.ts` is the contract the docs-side consumer reads.

## Running a capture

Needs a local stack (`NOCTURNE_DEV_AUTO_LOGIN=false aspire start` from the repo root; with dev
auto-login on, the sign-in pages sign straight through and cannot be photographed) — capture drives the dev-only seeding API,
which only exists when the API runs in Development — and a browser binary, which pnpm does not
install for you:

```bash
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots exec playwright install chromium  # once per machine
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots run capture                       # seed, shoot, write manifest.json
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots run validate                      # definitions only; no stack, no browser
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots run check-refs                    # markdown references vs images on disk
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots run check-embeds                  # docs <Screenshot> ids and anchors vs the manifest
pnpm --filter @nocturne/screenshots run diff-stats                    # what a capture just changed, against HEAD
```

`diff-stats` reads the working tree against the committed images and prints a markdown table of
how much of each one moved, plus anything added, deleted, resized or unreadable. `--output <file>`
writes the same table to disk; `--restore-identical` puts committed bytes back for images whose
pixels did not change, so an encoder re-quantising the same render never shows up as drift. A
percentage is a shortlist of what to look at, not a verdict: a fraction of a percent can still be
the label a docs page quotes.

A successful run tidies up after itself: images no manifest entry claims are deleted, and the
tenants it seeded are removed. A failed one leaves both behind to be inspected.

`NOCTURNE_API_URL` overrides the API base (default `http://localhost:1610`); a worktree gets dynamic
ports, so read yours from `aspire describe`.

Locale, timezone, viewport, device scale and the browser clock are pinned in `src/capture.ts` and
must stay that way: a screenshot is only reviewable as a diff against the one it replaces.

## Regeneration workflow

`.github/workflows/screenshot-regen.yml` boots a stack on the runner, runs the capture, and opens
a PR on `docs/screenshot-regen` with the `diff-stats` table in its body when the images move.
Dispatch it from the Actions tab ("Documentation screenshots" → Run workflow) after a UI change
you expect the docs to show. It is dispatch-only: the seeded data is anchored to the calendar
date, so an unattended schedule would drift on every run and bury real UI changes in data noise —
a schedule becomes viable once seeding can replay identical data shapes across days.

A capture failure — a stale anchor, a route that will not settle — fails the run and opens
nothing; the capture log and whatever images it managed to write are attached to the run as an
artifact.

Two GitHub settings caveats: creating the PR at all requires "Allow GitHub Actions to create and
approve pull requests" (Settings → Actions → General), and GitHub does not run workflows on a PR
opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so it arrives with no checks — close and reopen it to start them.

## When a run fails to settle

A capture is only taken once the route has been free of skeletons, "Loading" text, coach marks and
in-flight remote queries for an unbroken moment; otherwise the entry fails with what was still
outstanding, e.g.

```
some-entry: /somewhere did not settle within 120000ms (34 skeleton placeholders; 8 remote queries in flight)
```

Two very different things produce that, and the message reads the same either way.

Remote queries stuck in flight while the API itself answers them in milliseconds is the dev server,
not the app: a `vite dev` that has been up for hours, through several dependency re-optimisations,
starts accepting remote-function requests and never answering them. Stopping and starting
`nocturne-web` clears it.

The other is the app, and the tell is `renderer did not answer N probes` alongside the skeletons:
the page's main thread is pegged, so the queries only *look* outstanding — nothing is left to
notice them landing. Restarting clears nothing, and a route that behaves on an empty tenant and
hangs on a seeded one is pointing at a render loop rather than at the capture. Check whether the
renderer answers at all before reaching for the dev server.

## Arranging state, and who is looking

An entry that needs something to exist before it can be photographed — a guest link, a clock face,
an enrolled authenticator — declares an `arrange`. It is handed the seeded tenant and a `fetch` that
calls the real API as that tenant's owner, and it runs **once per entry**, not once per theme: the
arrangement lives on the server, and both themes photograph the same one. An `arrange` may reach no
dev-only shortcut that production lacks: if the app cannot be put into the state through its own
API, the screenshot is describing something users cannot reach either. (Standing up a *signed-in
browser* is the exception, and the one the runner already makes for every owner session.)

Whatever `arrange` returns fills `{key}` holes in `route`. A hole that nothing filled fails the run.
A route that is *only* a hole may resolve to a full URL on another origin, which is how the public
share view — served from `{token}.share.{base-domain}` — is reached. An arrangement that exists only
for the state it leaves on the server returns an empty map.

State the app only ever shows once — the public share link, which the server keeps a digest of —
cannot be arranged at all: it has to be created from the browser in a `prepare`, or the capture
photographs the placeholder where the address should be.

`session` decides who is looking:

- **`owner`** (the default) signs the browser in as the seeded tenant's owner.
- **`anonymous`** never visits the login link, so the capture shows what a stranger with a link sees.
- **`isolated`** is a signed-out context created for that one entry and closed after it. Use it when
  a `prepare` signs in: on the shared anonymous context that session would outlive the entry, and
  every later anonymous capture would photograph a signed-in browser.

`owner` and `anonymous` each reuse one context per theme and viewport, so the sign-in is paid for once and an
anonymous entry cannot inherit a session.

## Ids and anchors

An `id` is a permanent handle. Docs pages point at it, so adding is safe and renaming is not.

`anchors` name the parts of a screenshot a docs callout can point at, mapping a name to a CSS
selector. Capture records each one's box in image pixels, relative to the image's own top-left, so
the docs side can draw a numbered marker without knowing anything about the app's markup. Prefer
`data-testid` over structural selectors, and add one to the app if nothing stable exists.

A selector that matches nothing **fails the run**. That is the point: it means the UI moved and the
callout — and probably the prose around it — is now describing something that is not there.
