# Google Health connector

Open **Settings -> Connectors & Apps -> Server Connectors -> Google Health**.
The connector requests read-only Google access and writes steps, heart rate,
body weight and sleep directly to Nocturne's existing health histories. It does
not introduce a separate health database or provide treatment recommendations.

## Database deployment

Deployment applies two EF Core migrations for reconciliation staging in the
existing database. They create `google_health_reconciliation_runs` and
`google_health_reconciliation_ids`, followed by tenant row-level security,
cascading cleanup of staged IDs and an index for expiring abandoned runs.
These tables hold temporary import administration, not native health histories.

If the initial migration is not registered but either staging table already
exists, it warns in the migration log and recreates only these two tables in
the migration transaction. Staged IDs from an interrupted import are discarded;
retrying the import rebuilds them. Native health data, connector credentials and
settings are not removed. Unexpected external dependencies prevent replacement
and roll back the transaction; the migration never uses `DROP ... CASCADE`.
Already registered migrations are skipped on upgrades and restarts, so existing
staging is not routinely reset. Back up the database before upgrading.

## Google Cloud setup

1. Enable the Google Health API in your Google Cloud project.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen and add test users while the app is in testing.
3. Create an OAuth client of type **Web application**.
4. Register the HTTPS callback URL displayed by Nocturne, ending in
   `/settings/connectors/google-health/callback`.
5. Enter the client ID and secret, choose an import start date, and sign in to Google.
6. Review the inventory, select supported data types, and choose **Save selection and import**.

Secrets use Nocturne's encrypted connector configuration. OAuth authorization
uses state and PKCE validation. Google test-mode grants may expire after seven
days; production use can require Google verification. Only data made available
by Google and covered by the granted scopes can be imported.

## Imports and synchronization

- **Import data from** requests historical data; seven days is the default window,
  not a maximum. Explicit dates can extend back to 2000-01-01.
- **Save import settings** saves the selection without immediately importing.
  Clearing the selection pauses imports without removing the connection or data.
- **Save selection and import** queues a manual import. Leaving the page does not
  cancel the server-side operation. **Sync now** retries the current selection.
- Automatic synchronization normally runs every 15 minutes. After a successful
  import it resumes from the stored watermark with a five-minute overlap; without
  a watermark it uses the configured history window. An older backfill never moves
  the watermark backwards. The initial import date is consumed after its successful
  manual import.
- Each type is read page by page and written through its native Nocturne service.
  The maximum is 10,000 pages per type and operation; reaching the limit fails
  explicitly instead of reporting an incomplete history as complete.
- The page-by-page reader and reconciliation staging are the same bounded import
  path used by the connector integration; Google Health does not maintain a
  second, competing chunking implementation. Each page is written before the
  next one is requested, so large histories do not have to fit in one request or
  one in-memory batch.
- An empty result is not an error and is not converted into a zero measurement.
  Unsupported destinations are shown in the inventory but cannot be selected.
- Disconnecting keeps imported data. Deleting imported Google data is a separate,
  confirmed action scoped to this connector and the current tenant.

## Recovering a failed historical import

The **Import recovery** card links platform administrators to **Settings ->
Administration -> Reset Connector Cursors**. Select the tenant, enter the
earliest date that should be re-read, and start the background reset. Google
Health is a normal configured connector in that reset job, so the same bounded
page reader, native writes and idempotency keys are used. A reset does not delete
the existing health history; already imported rows are safely de-duplicated.
Use the job progress to see whether Google Health succeeded or failed, and cancel
the job before starting another reset if it is still running.

## UI copy and translations

The connector page and its shared source row use Wuchale PO catalogues, just like
the rest of the application. When copy is added or moved, run the Wuchale
extraction and keep every locale's `msgstr` non-empty; the lightweight
`google-health-translations.test.js` check compiles representative production
strings for every locale and verifies that `{0}` and `<0/>` placeholders are
preserved. Product names such as **Google Health** and **eHbA1c** remain
unchanged where the translation service would otherwise split or translate the
name.

Sleep uses the session's **end time**, as required by the
[Google Health filter contract](https://developers.google.com/health/filters).
The lower time boundary is inclusive and the upper boundary exclusive. A night
starting before the requested range is included when it ends inside that range,
with its stages intact. Local filtering and reconciliation use the same window.
Use **Refresh inventory** to rescan availability after a failed inventory request.

Completed types are reconciled within their requested windows. Native source
identifiers support repeat imports and updates. Reconciliation is scoped to Google
Health and the current tenant; an empty type result does not delete its stored
history. A failure on a later page or type can leave earlier batches saved, while
the import watermark remains unchanged. Retrying is supported; an import is not
one database transaction covering all types.

## Errors and progress

While the connector page is open, import progress refreshes every two seconds
without depending on websocket delivery. The percentage represents data-type
stages, not record-count completion or estimated time remaining. Errors expose a
technical code and, where applicable, HTTP status. Use those with the API-server
log; do not share credentials or health data.

## Verification limits

Automated tests cover authorization, filters, pagination, native writes,
reconciliation, repeated imports, progress and failure handling using synthetic
data. They do not authorize a live Google account or prove availability of every
device's data. Real consent and account-specific imports require runtime testing.
