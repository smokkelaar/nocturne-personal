//! Minimal SignalR JSON hub-protocol client over a WebSocket.
//!
//! There is no mature Rust SignalR client, so this hand-rolls the parts the companion needs against
//! `DataHub`: HTTP `negotiate` (negotiation is required — the server does not allow skip-negotiation),
//! open the WebSocket with the returned connection token, send the JSON-protocol handshake, invoke the
//! `Authorize` and `Subscribe` hub methods, answer server pings, and surface incoming invocations —
//! the typed device targets plus any target the caller subscribed to by name. Messages are JSON
//! records terminated by the 0x1e record separator.
//!
//! This is deliberately not a general SignalR client: it handles invocation (type 1), ping (type 6),
//! completion (type 3), and close (type 7); other frame types are ignored.
