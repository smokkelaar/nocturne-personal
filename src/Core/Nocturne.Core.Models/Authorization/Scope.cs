/// <summary>
/// The scope vocabulary. Every authorization atom in Nocturne is declared here once, whether it is
/// reached through an OAuth grant or through a tenant membership.
///
/// Atoms fall into three tiers: read, readwrite, and full access (<c>*</c>). A readwrite scope
/// carries the whole write authority over its own data category — create, update and delete of a
/// single record alike. Withholding delete from a grant that may already rewrite every field of a
/// record buys nothing, and the V4 surface has always read the tier that way. Full access differs
/// by spanning every category and the tenant-administration atoms; the one data verb it alone
/// unlocks is the V1 query-driven bulk delete, which empties a collection in one request and so is
/// not something a per-category grant should reach.
///
/// Two sets carve the vocabulary up, and the distinction is load-bearing:
/// <see cref="ValidRequestScopes"/> is what an OAuth client may ask for at <c>/authorize</c>;
/// <see cref="MemberGrantableScopes"/> is the wider set a tenant role may confer. The
/// tenant-administration atoms sit only in the second, because there is no per-client scope ceiling
/// to bound a request for them and no consent screen that could meaningfully describe them.
