/**
 * Encoding for the `value` a card button round-trips back to its handler.
 *
 * A card addresses one tenant and the excursion its buttons act on. Both are
 * UUIDs, and both together do not fit: Telegram caps `callback_data` at 64
 * bytes, and `encodeTelegramCallbackData` in `@chat-adapter/telegram` spends
 * `chat:{"a":"<actionId>","v":"<value>"}` on the envelope — 20 bytes plus the
 * action id, leaving 35 for the value under `ack_alert`, the longest id an alert
 * card carries. Two 36-character UUIDs need 73, and 32 raw bytes cannot be
 * encoded into 35 printable ones either, so a tighter encoding alone is not
 * enough. Over the limit the adapter throws and the whole delivery is marked
 * failed, so the budget binds every adapter, not just Telegram.
 *
 * The excursion therefore travels as the base64url of its 16 raw bytes (22
 * chars, lossless — the handler acknowledges it by id), and the tenant as the
 * *last* 8 characters of the same encoding. The slice has to come off the tail:
 * a tenant id is a UUIDv7 whose leading 48 bits are its creation millisecond,
 * so tenants provisioned concurrently share their head outright, while the
 * trailing bytes are rand_b and are random. Those 8 characters name one of the
 * tapping user's own linked tenants; a key matching two of them is refused by
 * {@link pickCandidate} rather than guessed. 8 + 1 + 22 = 31 bytes, 60 with the
 * `ack_alert` envelope.
