/// and the caller chooses which by setting <see cref="StateSpan.Category"/> in the request body,
/// so a single declared controller scope would either under-gate the other three categories or
/// deny the common one. The same shape as <see cref="ActivityWriteScopeGuard"/>: the controller
/// applies this before delegating to the service.

/// The category that matters most here is <see cref="StateSpanCategory.DataExclusion"/>, which
/// marks a window of glucose readings as not to be counted. No statistic or report filters on it
/// yet, so every reading still counts; it is still a glucose-integrity record rather than a
/// treatment annotation, and gating it on the treatments scope would let a treatments-only
/// credential mark a hypo for exclusion.
