/**
 * Resolves a chat-platform user to a specific Nocturne tenant link, then
 * invokes `callback` with the resolved link and a nested request context that
 * makes `getApi()` return the tenant-scoped api client. `explain` receives the
 * user-facing message on every non-success branch.
 *
 * This is the chokepoint that every tenant-scoped handler goes through, via
 * {@link requireLink} (slash commands) or {@link requireLinkForAction} (card
 * button taps). Handlers that don't wrap their body in one of those will have
 * `getApi()` throw.
 *
 * ## Resolution logic
 *
 * Calls the directory.resolve endpoint via the unscoped api client, then:
 *
 * - **Zero candidates** → explains "your account isn't linked yet, run
 *   /connect" and returns null without invoking callback.
 *
 * - **`tenantId` given** (the invocation is already bound to a tenant, e.g. an
 *   alert card carries the tenant the alert fired for) → the candidate for that
 *   tenant, or, if the tapping user has no link to it, explains that and
 *   returns null. Never falls back to another tenant.
 *
 * - **One candidate** → ignores any label arg (even if it doesn't match —
 *   assume the user typed a different platform's label by mistake; give them
 *   the only thing they have linked) and invokes callback with that link.
 *
 * - **Multiple candidates + label arg matches exactly one** → invokes
 *   callback with the matched link.
 *
 * - **Multiple candidates + no label arg + exactly one marked default** →
 *   invokes callback with the default link.
 *
 * - **Multiple candidates + no label arg + no single default** → explains the
 *   ambiguity, listing each label and display name, and returns null.
 *
 * - **Multiple candidates + label arg does not match any** → explains "no link
 *   named X, try one of: ..." and returns null.
 *
 * Returns `null` on any non-success branch so callers can detect whether
 * their work actually ran.
 *
 * @example
 * // Zero candidates branch:
 * //   User invokes /bg, never ran /connect.
 * //   Ephemeral: "Your Discord account isn't linked to a Nocturne account
 * //   yet. Run `/connect` to get started."
 *
 * @example
 * // Single candidate branch:
 * //   User has one link labelled "home". They run `/bg wrong-label`.
 * //   Resolves to "home" anyway.
 *
 * @example
 * // Multi + label match:
 * //   User has "home" and "work". They run `/bg work`.
 * //   Resolves to the "work" link.
 *
 * @example
 * // Multi + default:
 * //   User has "home" and "work", with "work" set as their default.
 * //   They run `/bg`. Resolves to "work" without asking.
 *
 * @example
 * // Multi + ambiguous:
 * //   User has "home" and "work", neither set as default. They run `/bg`.
 * //   Ephemeral: "You have multiple linked Nocturne accounts: `home` (Home),
 * //   `work` (Work). Use `/bg <label>` to pick one, or set a default in
 * //   Settings → Integrations → Discord."
 *
 * @example
 * // Multi + label not found:
 * //   User has "home" and "work". They run `/bg beach`.
 * //   Ephemeral: "No linked account named `beach`. Your linked accounts:
 * //   `home`, `work`."
 *
 * @example
 * // Bound tenant branch:
 * //   User has "home" and "work" and taps Acknowledge on a "work" alert.
 * //   Resolves to "work" without asking, because the card carries its tenant.
