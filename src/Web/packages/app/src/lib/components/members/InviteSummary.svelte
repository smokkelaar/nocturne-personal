          While you have Nocturne open, you'll see alerts as they happen.
          Getting alerts when Nocturne isn't open, for example on your phone,
          depends on how alerts have been set up. Ask the person who invited
          you.

            the alert being passed on to other people.

            You can press Mute for me on an alert to stop it reaching you. Other
            people keep getting it until someone who manages alerts acknowledges
            it, or it ends.
