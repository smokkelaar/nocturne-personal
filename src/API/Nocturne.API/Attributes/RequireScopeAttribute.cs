/// <remarks>
/// Scope satisfaction is evaluated by <see cref="Scope.Satisfies(IEnumerable{string}, string)"/> which supports

/// The granted scopes are further refined by <see cref="Middleware.MemberScopeMiddleware"/>
/// based on the user's tenant membership roles.
/// <para>
/// A read requirement is decided on the resolved scope set alone, so it admits the anonymous
/// public-share principal, whose scopes are narrowed to
/// <see cref="Scope.PublicShareScopes"/>. A requirement naming anything other than
/// read also requires an authenticated caller, so no anonymous principal can pass a write gate
/// however its scopes are resolved. An empty scope set is rejected either way.
