   * surface a top-center toast with Snooze / Dismiss / Mute-rule actions.
   *
   * The component intentionally does _not_ show every active alert — that's the
   * persistent banner's job (currently <see cref="AlertBanner"/>). This is for
   * the trust-critical "you should know about this RIGHT NOW" moment.
   *
   * Actions are optimistic: the card leaves the queue immediately and is
   * restored only if the command fails. Acknowledge additionally pushes a
   * single-flight override into the shared getActiveAlerts query so the banner
   * reflects it in the same round-trip.
   *
   * Snooze state is the server's `snoozedUntil`, not ours: a snoozed alert has
   * no card, and it earns a fresh one once the server stops reporting the
   * snooze, which is also when its notifications resume.
