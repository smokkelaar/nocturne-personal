/// A device token belongs to the site, not to a person. Issuing it to a human subject makes it
/// inherit things that subject is rather than things it was granted: an owner who is also the
/// instance's platform admin would hand every uploader token instance-wide reach, and a token
/// outlives the person, so an ownership change or a revoked membership stops every device at once.
/// <para>
/// A system subject is the existing answer to "authenticated but stands for no one", as the
/// Public subject a share link runs as already is. It is excluded from
/// <see cref="OrphanedSubjectFilter"/>, so holding a membership without a passkey does not read as
/// an account locked out of the tenant, and it is never a platform admin.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Its membership carries <see cref="Scope.FullAccess"/> because the bound on a device token is the
/// token's own scope list: <c>MemberScopeMiddleware</c> intersects the two, so a narrower membership
/// here would silently cap every token rather than the one that deserved it. The subject cannot sign
/// in, so the membership is reachable only through a grant.
