/**
 * A `catch` around a generated remote call that never reads the reason throws
 * it away and assigns fixed copy in its place, so someone is told "please try
 * again" about a duplicate name or a validation failure that retrying cannot
 * fix. `describeSubmitError` and `remoteErrorMessage` both take that copy as
 * their fallback, so converting a site never loses the wording it had.
 *
 * Binding nothing is one way; binding a name and never reading it is the same
 * loss, and the one a grep for `catch {` does not see. Reading it only in a
 * `console` call beside fixed copy is the third. All three are asked the same
 * question here.
 *
 * Swallowing is sometimes right — a poll that runs again, an optimistic
 * rollback that reports itself by reappearing — and those say why in a comment
 * on the first line of the catch. That is all this asks for, and it is worth
 * knowing the limits:
 *
 * - It reads text, pairing a bare `catch` with the nearest `try` by brace depth,
 *   so a brace inside a string or comment can mispair it, and a `}` inside a
 *   string ends the catch body early.
 * - Whether a binding is read is a word match over that body text, so naming it
 *   in a string or a comment counts — `catch (e)` beside copy containing a
 *   standalone "e", or a `// TODO surface err`, passes without surfacing
 *   anything. A destructured binding, `catch ({ status })`, is not matched at
 *   all and so is never asked. Closing these needs an AST, which this is
 *   deliberately not.
 * - A comment satisfies it. It cannot tell a reason from an excuse; a site that
 *   keeps its fixed copy and adds a comment passes, and only review catches
 *   that.
 * - It sees calls to names imported from a `*.generated.remote` module, plus
 *   `.run()` and `.refresh()`. A remote call reached any other way is
 *   invisible.
