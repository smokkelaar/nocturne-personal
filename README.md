# Nocturne Personal

Personal extension fork of [nightscout/nocturne](https://github.com/nightscout/nocturne),
starting from the approved Daily source `3b7514591f854f4794deeeb75d43e33d979d1ee4`.
The working/default branch is **personal**. `.personal/version.json` records the
extension version and exact Daily base; the upstream `main` branch is not our
release branch.

Install through the separate **Nocturne Personal Release** app in
[nocturne-home-assistant](https://github.com/smokkelaar/nocturne-home-assistant).
Official and Latest remain independent and unchanged. Personal starts empty;
never copy their databases, passkeys or tokens into it.

The daily source workflow merges only the Daily base already accepted by that
HA repository. Merge conflicts stop it; it never resets personal changes.
Source checks are not runtime tests: the HA repository separately compiles API
and web from an exact Personal commit and tests the container and upgrade before
offering an installable update. No floating source/image is downloaded at startup.

Inherited upstream release workflows are preserved in `.github/upstream-workflows/`
but are not executed. Only the two Personal workflows are active. No upstream
mobile, desktop, package or container releases are published by this fork.

Personal adds a **Personal** navigation item for tenant administrators:

- **Google Health**: Google OAuth with selectable steps, heart rate and weight;
  encrypted offline credentials, partial consent, 15-minute polling, a configurable
  1–90 day reconciliation window and a paginated readings view. Imported readings
  are shown in Personal, not yet projected into upstream reports or therapy models.
- **Medication log**: actual administrations or skipped doses for Mounjaro and
  similar medicines; explicit ingredient, amount/unit, time, route, optional site
  and notes. Edit/delete use revision checks. No dosing schedules, insulin/IOB
  calculations, pen-click conversion or treatment recommendations.

See [Personal usage](PERSONAL_USAGE.md) for Google setup, privacy, limitations and
testing. Keep credentials and health data out of commits, Actions logs and issues.
Preserve upstream licensing and attribution; this is experimental software, not a
validated medical device.

## Upstream project

A modern, high-performance diabetes management platform built with .NET 10. Nocturne is a complete rewrite of the Nightscout API with full feature parity, providing native C# implementations of all endpoints with optimized performance and modern cloud-native architecture.

## Quick Start with Aspire (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js 24+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/)

Aspire orchestrates all services with a single command:

```bash
aspire start
```

Aspire will automatically:

- Start PostgreSQL in a container
- Run database migrations
- Start the Nocturne API and SvelteKit frontend
- Launch any configured data connectors
- Set up service discovery, health checks, and a YARP gateway

Once running, open the Aspire dashboard link from the console output to see all services. Access the app at `https://nocturne.localhost:1612`.

In run mode the AppHost pins two host ports (main checkout; worktrees stay dynamic):

- **`https://nocturne.localhost:1612`** — the YARP gateway (the app; tenants at `https://<slug>.nocturne.localhost:1612`)
- **`http://localhost:1610`** — nocturne-api directly (stable target for scripts and the dev-only admin API)

The API always runs with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` under `aspire start`, so the dev-only surface (`/api/v4/dev-only/*`) exists locally and never in published images.

## Multitenancy and Passkeys (Local Domains)

The default local base domain is **`nocturne.localhost`**. Browsers resolve every `*.localhost` name to loopback themselves, so tenant subdomains (`sleepy.nocturne.localhost`) need no DNS or hosts-file setup, and WebAuthn accepts `nocturne.localhost` as the passkey Relying Party ID — unlike bare `localhost`, which browsers reject on subdomain origins as a public suffix.

TLS: if [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is installed (`winget install FiloSottile.mkcert` / `brew install mkcert`), the AppHost generates a trusted wildcard certificate for `*.nocturne.localhost` automatically — note this runs `mkcert -install`, which adds the mkcert root CA to your system trust store. Without mkcert, the gateway falls back to the ASP.NET dev certificate and tenant subdomains show a browser certificate warning (functional, just noisy).

Migrating from an older checkout: the local base domain used to be bare `localhost`, and passkeys are scoped to the WebAuthn RP ID derived from it — credentials registered under the old domain won't assert under `nocturne.localhost`. Register a fresh passkey once (then export it as a fixture, below).

### Seed a loginable tenant with data in one call

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1610/api/v4/dev-only/admin/seed-tenant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "slug": "sleepy", "displayName": "Sleepy", "ownerUsername": "dev", "sampleData": true }'
```

The response includes `url` and `loginLink` — open the `loginLink` in a browser and you're signed in as the owner, looking at realistic CGM data. `GET /api/v4/dev-only/auth/login?tenant=<slug>&format=json` (or POST) returns a token pair for headless clients instead. `scripts/dev-smoke.cs` runs the whole path end to end: `dotnet run scripts/dev-smoke.cs`.

Other one-call dev endpoints: `POST /api/v4/dev-only/admin/tenants/{id}/seed-sample-data` (populate an existing tenant) and `POST /api/v4/dev-only/admin/tenants/{id}/recovery-mode` (orphan a member's credentials to exercise the break-glass flow).

### Log in with your real passkey everywhere

Register a passkey once (any tenant's normal setup/login flow), then export it as a committed fixture:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1610/api/v4/dev-only/auth/passkey-fixture > docs/seed/dev-identities.json
```

WebAuthn public keys are not secret, and subjects are global rather than tenant-scoped, so the fixture is safe to commit. On every Development startup the API re-inserts the fixture's subjects and credentials (surviving DB wipes), and `seed-tenant` adds each fixture subject as an owner of new tenants — your authenticator signs in to all of them. The fixture only works while the base domain (and thus the RP ID) stays the same, which the `nocturne.localhost` default guarantees.

### Custom local domain (optional)

To use a dedicated domain on port 443 instead:

```bash
cd src/Aspire/Nocturne.Aspire.Host
dotnet user-secrets set "LocalDev:Domain" "nocturne.test"
```

This requires mkcert and one hosts-file line per tenant slug (`127.0.0.1 sleepy.nocturne.test` — hosts files don't support wildcards). The app is then at `https://nocturne.test` with no port.

## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to deploy Nocturne is with the production Docker Compose bundle. Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nightscout/nocturne/releases) includes ready-to-use artifacts, or you can generate them locally.

### Using a release

Download `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env.example` from the [latest release](https://github.com/nightscout/nocturne/releases).

```bash
# 1. Copy the env template and fill in your passwords and domain
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start Nocturne
docker compose up -d
```

### Behind a CDN

The bundled Caddy is the hop that decides which address Nocturne records in audit rows and counts
rate limits against, and by default that is whoever connected to it. Behind a CDN that is the CDN's
edge, so every visitor sharing a point of presence shares one bucket. Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the
CDN's published ranges (Cloudflare's are at <https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/>) and Caddy will take
the visitor's address from `CF-Connecting-IP`, or from the last entry of `X-Forwarded-For` that no
declared proxy vouched for — but only from those ranges, so nobody else can claim to be someone
they aren't. This works for any CDN, not just Cloudflare. Leave it alone if no CDN is in front, and
never set it empty: an empty value is a Caddy startup error, not a way to turn the feature off.

The production compose includes [Watchtower](https://github.com/nicholas-fedor/watchtower) for automatic container updates (checks daily), and omits the Aspire dashboard and Scalar API explorer. Watchtower will automatically pull new images as they are published — no manual updates needed. It runs in label-only mode and every service in the bundle carries `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true`, so it only ever updates Nocturne's own containers — anything else on the same Docker host is left alone.

### First-run setup

A fresh install has no tenants, so the API answers every request with `503 {"error":"setup_required"}` until the first owner secures the instance. This is expected — it's the signal for the web UI to show the setup wizard.

**In a browser (normal path).** Open your Nocturne site (the apex `https://<BASE_DOMAIN>/`). The setup wizard walks you through creating the first tenant and registering a passkey (or linking an OIDC provider). When it completes you're shown a set of recovery codes — save them. That's the whole setup.

**Headless / automated setup (no browser).** Trusted automation can stand up a tenant — create it, configure connectors, change settings, push data — before any human registers a passkey, using the `INSTANCE_KEY` from your `.env`. The instance key is the highest-trust service credential (cross-tenant platform admin), so treat it like a root password. Requests authenticate with two headers: `X-Instance-Key` carrying the **SHA-256 hex of `INSTANCE_KEY`**, and an `X-Instance-Service` marker naming the caller.

```bash
# The X-Instance-Key header is the SHA-256 hex of your raw INSTANCE_KEY, not the key itself.
KEY_HASH=$(printf %s "$INSTANCE_KEY" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)

# 1. Create the first tenant. This endpoint is anonymous and tenantless — call it on the apex.
curl -fsS -X POST "https://$BASE_DOMAIN/api/v4/setup/tenant" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slug":"alice","displayName":"Alice"}'

# 2. Configure the tenant as trusted automation. Target the tenant's subdomain and
#    present the instance key + service marker. Normal tenant traffic still gets 503
#    until a human completes setup, but instance-key calls are allowed through.
curl -fsS -X PUT "https://alice.$BASE_DOMAIN/api/v4/connectors/config/Dexcom/secrets" \
  -H "X-Instance-Key: $KEY_HASH" \
  -H 'X-Instance-Service: nocturne-setup-agent' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }'
```

When the human is ready, they open the site and register the first passkey through the normal wizard — recovery codes and all — exactly as on a brand-new instance. Their pre-configured connectors and data are already there. (A bare `X-Instance-Key` without the `X-Instance-Service` marker is ignored, so an instance key accidentally forwarded onto a browser request can't bypass setup.)

### Troubleshooting

**Redirected to `/setup` even though a tenant is already configured.** Two usual causes:

- **`BASE_DOMAIN` is unset.** The API resolves tenants as `{slug}.{BASE_DOMAIN}`, and the WebSocket bridge requires it. If it's empty, host→tenant resolution fails and the dashboard bounces to `/setup` (and the bridge logs `BASE_DOMAIN is required`). Set it in `.env` to the domain you serve Nocturne on, for **both** the API and web containers, then recreate them.
- **Single-tenant install served at the base domain.** If your one tenant lives at the apex (`https://<BASE_DOMAIN>/`, no subdomain), update to the latest image — older builds reported `setup_required` for `/api/v4/status` on the apex and bounced configured single-tenant installs to `/setup`.

### Generating locally

If you have the .NET 10 SDK and Aspire CLI installed, you can generate the production bundle from source:

```bash
dotnet run scripts/publish-release.cs              # outputs to ./release-output
dotnet run scripts/publish-release.cs ./deploy     # or specify a directory
```

### PostgreSQL Roles

Nocturne uses three separate PostgreSQL roles for defense in depth. All three have `NOBYPASSRLS` so they obey Row Level Security policies, even when the database has no superuser connected.

| Role                    | Purpose                                                                                | Privileges                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`nocturne_migrator`** | Runs EF Core migrations (schema DDL). Owns the database and `public` schema.           | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` on tables. Cannot bypass RLS.                                                        |
| **`nocturne_app`**      | Runtime connection pool for the .NET API. Owns nothing.                                | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on migrator-created tables. Cannot bypass RLS.                          |
| **`nocturne_web`**      | SvelteKit bot framework (chat state storage). Owns only its own `chat_state_*` tables. | `CREATE` on `public` schema (for its own tables only). No access to Nocturne tenant tables. Cannot bypass RLS. |

The bootstrap user (`POSTGRES_USER`) is only used for initial container setup. After `container-init/00-init.sh` runs, all application traffic flows through the three roles above. Passwords are set via environment variables in `.env`.

For bring-your-own PostgreSQL (not using the bundled container), run `docs/postgres/bootstrap-roles.sql` once as a superuser. See the comments in that file for details.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run every collected test (the opt-in E2E suite stays out)
dotnet test

# Run unit tests only
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration&Category!=Performance&Category!=E2E"

# Run the end-to-end suite (stands up the whole Aspire stack)
dotnet test tests/E2E/Nocturne.E2E.Tests -p:RunE2E=true

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
cd src/Infrastructure/Nocturne.Infrastructure.Data
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName

# Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) at `https://localhost:1612/scalar` when running locally.

Nocturne aims to match Nightscout's API 1:1, so any Nightscout API endpoint should be usable. Nocturne-only endpoints are scoped to v4.

## Observability

Both the API and web containers are instrumented with OpenTelemetry and export metrics, traces, and logs over **OTLP push** when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set. With no endpoint configured, telemetry is collected in-process and discarded with negligible overhead, so there is nothing to turn off on a default install. There is no Prometheus `/metrics` scrape endpoint — to use Prometheus/Grafana, run an OpenTelemetry Collector with an `otlp` receiver and a `prometheus` exporter.

- **Docker Compose:** add the `OTEL_*` variables to the `nocturne-api` and `nocturne-web` services.
- **Kubernetes (Helm):** set `observability.otlp.enabled: true` and `observability.otlp.endpoint` (lights up both containers). See the [Helm chart README](deploy/helm/nocturne/README.md#observability).

Full setup guide: [Observability docs](src/Web/packages/portal/src/content/docs/observability.svx).
