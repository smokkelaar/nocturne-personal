# Google Health connector

Open **Settings -> Connectors & Apps -> Server Connectors -> Google Health**.
The connector requests read-only Google access and writes steps, heart rate,
body weight and sleep directly to Nocturne's existing health histories. It does
not introduce a separate health database or provide treatment recommendations.

## Database deployment

Deployment applies two EF Core migrations for reconciliation staging in the
existing database. They create `google_health_reconciliation_runs` and
`google_health_reconciliation_ids`, followed by tenant row-level security,
cascading cleanup of staged IDs and an index for expiring abandoned runs.
These tables hold temporary import administration, not native health histories.

If the initial migration is not registered but either staging table already
exists, it warns in the migration log and recreates only these two tables in
the migration transaction. Staged IDs from an interrupted import are discarded;
retrying the import rebuilds them. Native health data, connector credentials and
settings are not removed. Unexpected external dependencies prevent replacement
and roll back the transaction; the migration never uses `DROP ... CASCADE`.
Already registered migrations are skipped on upgrades and restarts, so existing
staging is not routinely reset. Back up the database before upgrading.

## Google Cloud setup

1. Enable the Google Health API in your Google Cloud project.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen and add test users while the app is in testing.
3. Create an OAuth client of type **Web application**.
4. Register the HTTPS callback URL displayed by Nocturne, ending in
   `/settings/connectors/google-health/callback`.
5. Enter the client ID and secret, choose an import start date, and sign in to Google.
6. Review the inventory, select supported data types, and choose **Save selection and import**.

Secrets use Nocturne's encrypted connector configuration. OAuth authorization
uses state and PKCE validation. Google test-mode grants may expire after seven
days; production use can require Google verification. Only data made available
by Google and covered by the granted scopes can be imported.

## Imports and synchronization

- **Import data from** requests historical data; seven days is the default window,
  not a maximum. Explicit dates can extend back to 2000-01-01.
- **Save import settings** saves the selection without immediately importing.
  Clearing the selection pauses imports without removing the connection or data.
- **Save selection and import** queues a manual import. Leaving the page does not
  cancel the server-side operation. **Sync now** retries the current selection.
- Every sync fetches at most one calendar day (or, once history is caught up, the
  live "today" window) so a run always fits well inside the per-tenant sync
  timeout, regardless of how much history is requested. The first sync for a
  connection always imports today first, so recent data is available immediately.
  Later syncs then step backwards one day at a time towards the requested start
  date (the explicit import date, or the configured history window). Every ten
  backfill days, one sync re-fetches "today" instead, so recent data keeps
  arriving throughout a long backfill. A deep history (years) therefore takes many
  syncs — hours to days depending on the sync interval — rather than one attempt,
  and progress survives restarts since it is persisted after every step.
- An older backfill never moves the live watermark backwards. The initial import
  date is consumed once the backfill actually reaches it, not after a single sync.
- Heart rate is aggregated to one average reading per UTC minute before it is
  staged and written: Google Health reports near-continuous (often per-beat)
  samples, which are far more than any report needs and would multiply row counts
  and query time. The aggregate is stored like any other reading, so reports read
  it directly with no extra computation at request time.
- Each type is read page by page and written through its native Nocturne service.
  The maximum is 10,000 pages per type and operation; reaching the limit fails
  explicitly instead of reporting an incomplete history as complete.
- An empty result is not an error and is not converted into a zero measurement.
  Unsupported destinations are shown in the inventory but cannot be selected.
- Disconnecting keeps imported data. Deleting imported Google data is a separate,
  confirmed action scoped to this connector and the current tenant.


Sleep uses the session's **end time**, as required by the
[Google Health filter contract](https://developers.google.com/health/filters).
The lower time boundary is inclusive and the upper boundary exclusive. A night
starting before the requested range is included when it ends inside that range,
with its stages intact. Local filtering and reconciliation use the same window.
Use **Refresh inventory** to rescan availability after a failed inventory request.

Completed types are reconciled within their requested windows. Native source
identifiers support repeat imports and updates. Reconciliation is scoped to Google
Health and the current tenant; an empty type result does not delete its stored
history. A failure on a later page or type can leave earlier batches saved, while
the import watermark remains unchanged. Retrying is supported; an import is not
one database transaction covering all types.

## Errors and progress

While the connector page is open, import progress refreshes every two seconds
without depending on websocket delivery. The percentage represents data-type
stages, not record-count completion or estimated time remaining. Errors expose a
technical code and, where applicable, HTTP status. Use those with the API-server
log; do not share credentials or health data.

## Verification limits

Automated tests cover authorization, filters, pagination, native writes,
reconciliation, repeated imports, progress and failure handling using synthetic
data. They do not authorize a live Google account or prove availability of every
device's data. Real consent and account-specific imports require runtime testing.
