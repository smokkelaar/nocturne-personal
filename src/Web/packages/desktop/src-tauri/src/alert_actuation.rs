//! Device-action actuation loop: register, listen for `device_action` over SignalR, and reconcile
//! against the active-intents snapshot to drive Windows toasts and tray-icon flashing.
//!
//! The active-intents snapshot is the source of truth, not the live event. A live `device_action`
//! only triggers an immediate reconcile; the reconcile diffs the server's active set against
//! in-memory per-capability "currently actuating" sets keyed on excursion id, so it is idempotent (a
//! live event overlapping the periodic poll cannot double-actuate) and self-healing (an alert closed
//! while the companion was offline simply never appears, producing nothing). Acknowledged intents are
//! skipped. Each active intent actuates the subset of capabilities the server narrowed it to
//! (`notify` → toast, `tray_flash` → flash), so an intent can drive both, further narrowed by the
//! user's local opt-in (`device_capabilities`) so a capability switched off stops actuating before
//! the re-registration that withdraws it server-side lands. Reconcile runs on connect, on every
//! `device_action`, and on a ~30s interval.
//!
//! Registration happens once per process and the device id is reused across sessions; it is
//! re-resolved only when the server invalidates it (401/404 on the snapshot, 409 on register) or the
//! credential changes (unlink). A definitive credential loss (unlink/revoked grant) withdraws every
//! active actuation; transient failures keep state so nothing is spuriously withdrawn.
//!
//! Transport is the hand-rolled `signalr` client; if a connection attempt fails the loop falls back
//! to pure periodic reconcile until the next reconnect succeeds, so actuation degrades to polling
//! rather than stopping.
//!
//! The session here owns the app's only SignalR connection: besides the device targets it
//! subscribes to the DataHub's data events and forwards each as a nudge on `refresh_tx`, which the
//! glucose poll loop in `main.rs` consumes for low-latency refreshes. The 60s glucose poll remains
//! the fallback whenever the hub is down, exactly like the reconcile interval is for actuation.
